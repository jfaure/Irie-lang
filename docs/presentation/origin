Irie spawns in the void, and needs a way to create objects. At this moment, the only way is by self reference:

`Nat = Zero | Succ Nat`

These are the natural numbers as Peano defined them, eg. `2 = Succ (Succ Zero)` has type Nat
(In the backend, Irie is well aware that machine integers are the best choice for datas of this form)

Most of these entities can be decomposed in various ways: `x = a (b c)`, the reverse of this computation being precisely computation
