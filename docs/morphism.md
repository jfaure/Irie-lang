catamorphism -- unique homomorphism from initial algebra
anamorphism  -- corecursively construct
hylomorphism -- ana followed by cata
zygomorphism -- main recursive function and auxilary one
mutumorphism -- pair of mutually recursive functions
paramorphism -- body has access to immediate subterms + their images under the recursion
Apomorphism  -- paramorphism = prim recursion over inductive data , apo = prim corecursion over coinductive data
generalised fold -- polymorphic recursion for nested datatypes
rsfes (rec schemes from comonads) ⇒ context information available to body of recursion
this subsumes zygomorphisms and histomorphisms

adjoint folds are parametrised by an adjunction L ⊣ R and a distributive law σ : L . D → C . L
