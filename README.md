## Origin
Irie was created because there exists no pure functional language with first-class subtyping and an extreme emphasis on performance. The philosophy is to focus on a simple but powerful core language capable of naturally expressing additional desirable features: The subtyping calculus of constructions.

## Subtyping
Subtyping describes data flow explicitly and allows more accurate types. Formally, it is enough that a function of type `A -> B` exists for a subtyping relation `A <: B` to be permissible, in which case the compiler will automatically call the function where needed. Subtyping can cleanly (as opposed to an adhoc approach that won't scale) represent many desirable features (listed below). In practice it is both convenient and additionally a mechanism to give types some control over terms so they can guide a program to its optimal implementation (which in the presence of GPUs or distributed systems may be very complicated), without requiring programmers to pollute their algorithms with such details. The question of what (if any) custom subtyping relations libraries should add is still wide open. In any event, "excessive" subtyping relations cannot violate type safety.

Subtyping examples:
* Integer bitwidths `int32 <: int64` (C has this)
* Records with excess fields  `{x : Int , y : Int} <: {x : Int}`. This is not only convenient, it also informs the compiler that it can release resources (memory) tied in the dropped field 'y'
* Sum-types with fewer labels `[circle : Int] <: [circle : Int | square : Int]`
* Parameterized data (including GADTs): instead of `LC a = Var a | Abs (LC a) [LC a] | etc`, define `LC = VarString String | Abs LC [LC] | etc` then elsewhere substitute `VarString String` with eg. `VarInt Int`, when via subtyping the rest of the AST and many functions on it are reusable.
* Subtyping relations on algebraic data (records and sum types) are useful for quantitative type theory (including proof irrelevance).
* The dependent function space contains subtypes of the non-dependent function space
* Subtyping polymorphism is the sweet spot between parametric polymorphism and ad-hoc polymorphism, being both simple and equally powerful
* Bi-variant type parameters accurately describe structures where insertable types are different to extractable types; e.g. input of any graphical component into a list after which we can use only their 'onClick' functions
* Additional subtyping relations can enable automatic opportunistic optimisations

## Performance
### Fusion
Build-catas and stream fusion are impressive techniques for automatically eliminating intermediate datastructures (WIP)

### Memory
Memory locality has become a key factor for performance (cpu cache misses can be 10 to 10000+ times slower than a cpu instruction). Functional compilers take on the responsibility of managing all memory for the programmer, who has historically had good reason to distrust them. However, they have enough information to do a better job than even a C programmer using malloc could realistically maintain. For the next generation of functional compilers, both a GC and excessive reference counting are no longer acceptable. Irie aims to compile all data driven functions with essentially a custom allocator, which emphasizes arena style blanket-frees to completely clean up the data-stack when data falls out of scope, as well as a tailored memory representation for recursive datas. For example, the familiar list type: `List a = Empty | Next a (List a)` the (List a) pointer can be made implicit by use of an array. In fact all recursive data structures can exploit one implicit pointer, or in the case of Peano arithmetic, directly become machine numbers. I note here that it is essential to optimize such data structures directly rather than force users to use an opaque datatype (eg. `Vector a`), since that doesn't scale.

## (semi)-automatic distributed computing (including GPU-offloading)
High level abstractions are necessary if we are to comfortably program using GPUs and distributed networks, since forking GPU kernels and sending programs over a network is far too tedious, error-prone and inflexible to do manually. I propose to abstract implementation and optimisation details away from the terms and into a flexible lattice of types.
